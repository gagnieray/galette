/* Uncomment and tune to read user IP addresses from the X-Forwarded-For header

 * allow potential attackers to replace their IP addresses with anything,
 * increasing a bit their stealth (IP address don't mean that much anyway)

 * Hence the provided example is the simplest suitable for being behind
